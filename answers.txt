Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows us to track changes to our code over time, collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work, revert to previous versions if something breaks, and maintain separate branches for different features or experiments. It provides a full history of a project, making teamwork and version management much easier.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to healthcare. For example, machine learning models can analyze patient data to predict the likelihood of diseases like diabetes or heart disease, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses.
