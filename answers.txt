Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows us to track changes to our code over time, collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work, revert to previous versions if something breaks, and maintain separate branches for different features or experiments. It provides a full history of a project, making teamwork and version management much easier.
